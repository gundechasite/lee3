On this web site, GEA parents will be able to get (preferably free or some nominal cost) used uniforms/textbooks from other parents.

<u>How will buying used text books be helpful:</u>
<ol>
<li> At times, the textbooks are in school and parents need to access them at home. 
Say the new book is in school and used book bought here is at home, parents will be able to take kids revision.
<li> If we all parents, can have a copy of text books at home (preferably free of cost), 
we can request school to keep new textbooks in school itself for most days, thereby reducing bag weight.
<li> We could save money on external exam (e.g. olympiad, NSTSE books) cost.
</ol>

<u>How will buying used uniforms be helpful:</u>
<ol>
<li> Sometimes, a specific size of uniform is not available with vendor, e.g. winter has started and hoody is still not available, we could start using used hoody of another child.
<li> At times, we need extra set of uniform e.g. rainy days when clothes don't dry. 
A set bought here might be used as spare set of uniform.
<li> We keep extra set of clothes in school (say kid has wet uniform hence wears the clothes parents gave school for rest of the day). Instead of casual clothes, we could keep a set of uniform bought here.
